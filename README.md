- **Three.js:** A library for rendering 3D graphics, used to create interactive 3D backpack and other objects.
  
### Project Desription
- Home Page:
The home page features a clean and minimalist design with an interactive 3D model. Users can easily navigate the site and view the key features of the project. The interface provides intuitive controls to rotate and interact with the 3D object directly from the homepage.

- Textures:
The textures page allows users to explore various material options. Users can switch between different texture categories like body, metal, and strap materials, which dynamically update on the 3D model. Each texture option includes a preview button for a more interactive experience.

- 3D Model:
A 3D model is at the center of the project. Users can rotate, zoom, and change the model's materials using the Three.js library. The application supports high-quality texture mapping and smooth interactions, offering an immersive experience for users.
